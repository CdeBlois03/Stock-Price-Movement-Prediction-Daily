# Stock Predictor
This repository contains code for a Stock Predictor application, which focuses on predicting short-term stock price movements based on various factors and indicators. The application primarily targets daily stock price movements and utilizes a combination of historical price data, technical indicators, fundamental data, market sentiment indicators, economic indicators, market volatility measures, and external factors.

# Features and Relevant Factors
Historical Price Data: 
Includes open price, close price, high price, low price, and trading volume over a specified period.
Technical Indicators: Utilizes moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), stochastic oscillator, Bollinger Bands, MACD (moving average convergence divergence), and average true range (ATR).
Fundamental Data: 
Incorporates financial metrics and ratios such as earnings per share (EPS), price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, price-to-book (P/B) ratio, return on equity (ROE), debt-to-equity ratio, and revenue growth.
Market Sentiment Indicators: 
Considers sentiment from news articles, social media, and other sources.
Economic Indicators: Includes GDP growth rate, inflation rate, interest rates, unemployment rate, and consumer confidence index.
Market Volatility Measures: 
Evaluates historical volatility, implied volatility, and volatility indexes.
External Factors: Considers geopolitical events, regulatory changes, industry news, and macroeconomic trends.
Building Approach
Data Collection: 
Uses HTTP requests to fetch data from financial APIs or scrape data from websites.
Data Preprocessing: 
Implements preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
Feature Engineering: 
Defines functions to extract relevant features from the raw data.
Machine Learning Algorithms: 
Implements machine learning algorithms, considering feature weighting based on their relevance.
Training and Testing: 
Splits the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Prediction: 
Utilizes the trained model to make predictions on new data.
Evaluation: 
Evaluates the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics.
Iterative Improvement:
Refines the model by experimenting with different algorithms and features.

# Current Tasks
implement API for data collection, then implement data preprocessing.
